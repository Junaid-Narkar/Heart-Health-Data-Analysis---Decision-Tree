# Heart-Health-Data-Analysis---Decision-Tree

🩺#HeartHealthDataAnalysis

#Hello Everyone!

I am excited to share my latest project on predictive Data Analytics where I applied machine learning algorithms to analyze a healthcare dataset! This project involved the following key components:

🔍 #DataPreprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the dataset to prepare it for analysis, ensuring that categorical variables were properly encoded and numerical features were scaled.

📊 #KNN : Implemented KNN for classification, achieving insights into patient conditions based on various factors. Visualized the results with a confusion matrix to assess model performance.

🌳 #DecisionTree: Developed a decision tree model to illustrate decision-making processes in healthcare. This visual representation helped in understanding how different features influence patient outcomes.
